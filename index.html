				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p> I'm currently a PhD student in the Integrative Physiology and Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology programs at the University of Colorado Boulder.
					I'm interested in microbial community ecology, host-microbiome interactions, and drivers of resilience (both in microbial communities and in humans).
				</p>
				
				<p>Prior to starting my PhD, I was a MS student in Chris Lowry's Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Lab at CU Boulder. In the Lowry Lab, I studied the impacts of microbial
					exposure on mood affective and stress-related disorders. Specifically, I'm interested in the effects of diet and the built environment on host microbiomes,
					and I'm interested in developing multi-omics approaches to characterizing changes microbial communities and the immune system in response to psychosocial stress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before moving to Boulder in 2020, I completed my BS in Nutrition at East Tennessee State University, so I like to think about these questions in the context of diet 
					and lifestyle interventions. 
				</p>

				<p> Outside of the lab, I pursue ultra-distance running and cycling, and I also enjoy playing jazz. 
					Because of my combined interests in nutrition, endurance exercise, and stress physiology, 
					I enjoy talking about training/coaching philosophy and am open to future research on these topics.
				</p>
