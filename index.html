				<p> If you've made it here, thanks for visiting! 
					This page is currently experimental, as am I. (And as I am working to learn some basics of html.) </p>
				<p> I'm a graduate student in Chris Lowry's Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Lab within the Integrative Physiology department
					at the University of Colorado at Boulder. In the Lowry Lab, I study gut microbiota community structure and  diet-microbiome interactions
					in the context of mood affective and stressor-related disorders. 
					Specifically, I'm interested in developing multi-omics approaches to characterizing changes microbial communities
					and the immune system in response to psychosocial stress.<p>
				<p> Outside of the lab, I like to pursue ultra-distance running and cycling, and I also enjoy playing jazz. <p>
