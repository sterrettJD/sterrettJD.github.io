				<p> If you've made it here, thanks for visiting! 
					This page is currently experimental, as I am working to learn some basics of html. </p>
				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p> I'm a graduate student in Chris Lowry's Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Lab within the Integrative Physiology department
					at the University of Colorado at Boulder. In the Lowry Lab, I study gut microbiota community structure and  diet-microbiome interactions
					in the context of mood affective and stressor-related disorders. 
					Specifically, I'm interested in developing multi-omics approaches to characterizing changes microbial communities
					and the immune system in response to psychosocial stress.</p>

				<p> Outside of the lab, I pursue ultra-distance running and cycling, and I also enjoy playing jazz. 
					These interests occasionally tie themselves into my research, as nothing brings me more joy than contemplating 
					the combined effects of both psychosocial and physiological stressors during training cycles.</p>
