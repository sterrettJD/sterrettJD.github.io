				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p> I'm currently a PhD student in the Integrative Physiology and Interdisciplinary Quantitative (IQ) Biology programs at the University of Colorado Boulder.
					I'm interested in microbial community ecology, host-microbiome interactions, and drivers of resilience (both in microbial communities and in humans). 
				</p>
				<p>In the IQ Biology program, I've been fortunate enough to spend the '21-'22 academic year rotating with Cathy Lozupone, Noah Fierer, and Nichole Reisdorph, where I've
				   worked on projects regarding networks in microbiomes, identifying metabolic pathways in metagenomic datasets, and integrating metabolomics and microbiome data.
				</p>
				
				<p>Prior to starting my PhD, I was a MS student in Chris Lowry's Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Lab at CU Boulder. In the Lowry Lab, I've studied the impacts of microbial
					exposure on mood affective and stress-related disorders. Specifically, I'm interested in the effects of diet and the built environment on host microbiomes,
					and I'm interested in developing multi-omics approaches to characterizing changes to microbial communities and the immune system in response to psychosocial stress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before moving to Boulder in 2020, I completed my BS in Nutrition at East Tennessee State University, so I like to think about these questions in the context of diet 
					and lifestyle interventions. 
				</p>

				<p> Outside of the lab, I pursue ultra-distance running and cycling. 
					Because of my combined interests in nutrition, endurance exercise, and stress physiology, 
					I enjoy talking about training/coaching philosophy and am open to future research on these topics!
				</p>
