As I understand the lore, Josh Holmes (the race director) is good friends with Laz (who started the backyard format), and Josh started this race in his hometown (Jackson, TN) shortly after Laz’s silly “invention”. Laz didn’t hold his backyard ultra one year, so Josh has snagged the title of “longest continuously running”."

    "section": "The course",
    "text": "The course\nToF is run on the Union University trail system in Jackson, TN. It’s a 4.3 mile loop of what I would consider to be difficult trails. On paper, the loop doesn’t look to tough, but it gets complicated by many twists and turns (does it ever go straight??), rocks/roots, and slippery mud. It’s that sort of clay mud that feels like an ice rink when wet, so you have to pay close attention to how you put your weight down around the corners. On top of that, there are lots of ~10ft, 50% grade rollers (that GPS doesn’t pick up on), where you barely have traction due to the mud and are grasping for trees or anything else to not slide away. As someone who runs most of his miles on technical trails around Boulder, I’d say that while these aren’t like running Green Mtn, they’re very far from being a walk in the park.\nIt’s a neat course nestled in the woods, but it feels like there are two parts of the woods in each lap. The first half is in a loamy pine forest (Zack calls this part “the good woods”), then you pass onto the second half of the course (aka “the bad woods”, which really aren’t that bad, but the trail gets tougher). The second part has more vert, dropping down toward the creek bottoms twice (I believe), and there lots more of the aforementioned steep rollers. Josh does a great job marking the course with signs and flour; I think it’s been very rare that anybody gets lost or takes a wrong turn.\nOne aspect that makes ToF hard (relative to other backyard ultras) is that it stays on the trails through the night. Most backyard ultras switch to a 4.2 mile road loop at night, but ToF stays on the trails. One last point to speak to the course - some really strong folks run ToF every year (multiple multi-time Badwater finishers, Vol State 500k finishers, and tons of sub-20hr 100mile runners), and they’ve only seen the sun rise (&gt;100 miles) at this race once."

    "text": "Approaching this race\n\nZen and the art of learning from failure\nBack in October, I attempted to set a fastest/only known time for running 6 laps of the Boulder Skyline Traverse. That would be 100 miles with 36,000 ft of elevation gain, more vert than Hardrock or UTMB. There were a lot of things going on in my life and a snowstorm coming in, and I went into that run in the wrong headspace. I made a lot of mistakes that day, particularly including how I handled my own emotions, and I spent so much of feeling anxious, panicky, and frustrated at myself.\nIt’s been difficult to find words for that run where everything fell apart, but I’m convinced it fundamentally changed the way my brain works more than any other event of my life. I’m working on a write-up from it, and once it’s published it can be found here.\n\n\nLessons from crewing\nOne week before this, I crewed my roommate, Christian, while he sent it hard during the Colorado Cold Rush 50k. Christian’s a strong dude who’s incredibly capable of persisting through some dark places in races, which is evident from his success at backyrad ultras (including a win at Sky Pilots) and events &gt;100 miles. I got to watch him make an aggressive move at mile 20 of Cold Rush, then come into the aid station paying for it. Being able to help him dig into the well last weekend and thinking of how to help him keep moving reminded me of what I needed to focus on coming into this race. Here’s a pic of Christian and me that our friend Cody took!\n\n\n\nCrewing Christian at Cold Rush. Note: Cody is a fantastic (CO-based) photographer who wants to shoot more races! If you know of a race in need of a photographer, reach out to him!\n\n\n\n\nGoals and mindset\nI came into this run with a sense of calmness that was refreshing (and intentional) after the Skyline debacle. After crewing and lots of conversations about progress-oriented goals with Christian, my coach Tyler Fox, and my friend Jackson, I created my “jobs” for this race. I wouldn’t even say that these were goals; they were just what I had to do. My calmness going into this race came from knowing that I could do each of these jobs, that I’m fitter/more experienced than I’ve ever been before, and that if I did these things I could win (or at least run 100 miles).\nMy jobs were as follows:\n\nEat 100g (400kcal) carbs every hour.\nDrink 14oz of water with 1 serving skratch per hour.\nStart every loop. I wasn’t allowed to not start a loop - the only way to stop was to not finish a loop in 60 minutes.\nConsume 1 salt tab every other hour.\nFrom 11pm - sunrise, consume 75mg caffeine/hr, with a double dose at 3am.\n\nPretty simple, right?\n\n\nMantras\nInspired by Christian, I made a list of mantras/short reflections to keep in mind during the race. The big one was that I was just there to do my job, and that I knew what to do. In addition to that, I’d been thinking more about the concept lately of letting feelings (physical and non-physical) wash over me, like I’m sitting on the beach while the waves come in and out. Finally, when I ran Skyline, Christian wrote a little sign for me on the back of a piece of cardboard from an Ozo Coffee box, which said “No matter how dark it gets, it always gets light again.” I’ve found that line really comforting, and it’s fit in with similar ideas around impermanence that I’ve been trying to embrace, where I’ve been telling myself a lot this fall “if you’re feeling bad you just haven’t been running long enough to start feeling more gooder again.” I didn’t have to rely on these much until my ankle roll, but they came in very useful then.\n\n\n\nChristian’s sign"

I spent the first few laps chatting with Zack and remembering my lap time benchmarks. For future racers, 17:30 coming out of the woods, 30:00 at the “tree tunnel”, and 44:00 when you can see the aid station again should put you at the finish around 51 min, or if you don’t need that much time, walk it in after you hit the really steep bit and you’ll be at 54min. My stomach takes a bit to settle in the mornings, but today was worse, and I had to use the shent (portmanteau of two words, first word is what happens in it, second word is tent) every hour until sunset. Nothing was ever too bad, and I just kept in mind that my job was not to avoid an unsettled stomach; in fact, it was to put down enough sugar to keep my dentist awake at night. There’s bathroom access every hour at a backyard ultra, so there’s no reason to be afraid of the shent if it means you can fit a couple extra calories down the hatch.\n\n\n\nJosh at the race start"

Around 3 pm it kicked up and we knew we were getting wet that lap. At the start of that lap, Josh said to the group something along the lines of, “It’s gonna rain hard and storm. If you’re uncomfortable with that you can drop.” Halfway through that lap, the tornado sirens came on. I was running with Zack, so I looked at the old man (Zack is in fact old enough to be my dad) for sage wisdom and decision-making, and he grinned and said, “Let ’er rip!” So we kept rolling through the tornado sirens, and a couple minutes of torrential rain. It was almost 70 during the day, so I wore minimal clothing during the rain in order to prevent chafing, which was refreshing."

    "text": "Chest thongs in the night\nIt rained for 2 or 3 hours, with times of thunder/lightning, really nothing too bad. I ran a slightly faster lap right before sundown then used the extra time to towel off, change into dry clothes, and get settled with my night running gear. Taking inspiration from the Tour de France, one tradition at ToF is that the first person to finish each lap wears the relfective yellow “chong” (another portmanteau, chest + thong) on the next lap. Some people avoid the chong (and will wait at the finish line for someone else to pass them so they don’t have to wear it), but I think it’s fun. After this “fast lap”, I took the chong, which I wore every lap for the rest of the race.\nEarly in the day, Lindsay Phenix (yet another kind and supportive badass, who has outright won this race before and was the women’s winner this year, also she’s a coach if you’re looking for one!) was saying that she saw me show up in jorts and thought I would be racing in them. I jokingly said I would pull them out once the sun sets and the mind games start. During my post-rain outfit change, I decided to honor my word, and I threw on the jorts “for a lap”, but the pockets were working for me, and I ended up wearing them for the rest of the race. I really kept Courtney Dauwalter’s priority list in mind:\n\nLook good\nFeel good\nLook good\nSafety (this comes last, much to my mom’s chagrin)"

Maybe I’m still just a boy with an ego issue and an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex, but it mentally felt good to be “winning” each lap while wearing jorts and a chong. I was having fun too, cracking jokes all throught the night. When “caffeine time” started, we had plenty of jokes about how my mom never lets me have this stuff."

Race day was actually my mom’s birthday (I’m a bad son), so I was really grateful they came down to see me (I think it was their first time seeing me in an ultra). I felt bad that I didn’t have more time to hang out and chat with them, but I was pretty focused on taking care of things between laps and was very self-contained for those things. I told folks that it was my mom’s birthday, and Zack/David said now that my parents came down to the race on my mom’s birthday, I had to win and leave the trophy with her (also because I had no way to get it back to Boulder on the plane).\nUnrelated, I had brought some Little Debbie Christmas Tree Cakes for Josh (an ode to his post-Sequoyah Marathons Little Debbie Christmas Cake Miles) and had teased him throughout the day that I had a little surprise snack for him that I would break out after dark. Unbeknownst to me, Josh had joked on the prior lap with Marylou and Lindsay that he was just looking for an excuse to stop and eat cake, then I gave him a cake and he felt content to stop. Josh is a really tough dude with the capacity to suffer for a long time, so I was a bit bummed he wasn’t going to keep going with us, but it was funny that’s how that happened. Ultras aren’t all about suffering, sometimes you have to win people over with expensive gifts, good looks, and a nice personality."

    "text": "Loving my friends\nFrom 8-11 part of the rationale for putting a gap on folks during each lap was to call friends. I talked to Jess and Katie, and those miles really flew by. Jess and Katie, thank you - those conversations made an already good night better.\nPassing midnight (74 miles) was a PR for me. Around then, we were whittled down to a group of 4, including multi-time Badwater 135 finisher Lindsay Phenix, multi-time 500k finisher (Vol State & HOTS) Zack Lever, the second fastest 50-59 year old 100 miler in the world in 2023 David Eckardt, and this 24-year-old kid who’s still never run 100 miles. Them folks are absolute units and incredible people. Talking to every one of them makes my day brighter every year, and I’m always stoked to see what they’re up to. They’re also all very tough people.\n\n\n\nDavid, me, Lindsay, and Zack\n\n\n\n\n\nMore of the Final Four\n\n\nI saw them starting to struggle as the night went on. Lindsay and David’s replies to my banter got shorter and shorter, and Zack was slowly coming in later and making fewer jokes. I knew I wanted to run 100 miles and make this the second year in race history that folks have kept going as the sun came up, so I asked Josh how they were doing as I finished lap 19. He said they were working through stuff (which I already knew), and I was really hoping the 4 of us could keep going. That’s a weird emotion during a backyard ultra. You literally can’t keep going without the other people. Once you’re down to one runner, the race is over, even if you want to keep going.\nThis came up at the start of the next lap - Zack thought he had another battery for his light in his pocket and was going to replace it as we started. However, he realized after we started the lap that it wasn’t there, and you aren’t allowed aid after the lap starts. I didn’t want him to have to quit due to something silly like that, and I had been using both a headlamp and waist light, so I stopped to give him my waist light. Thinking about it now, it’s kind of poetic. Zack has really been a light in my life since we met, and his kind demeanor/words and belief in me have certainly gotten me through extra miles, so the least I can do for him is get him through an extra lap with an actual light. Lindsay turned back during that 20th lap (tying her own women’s course record), which I was really bummed to hear when Josh told me at halfway. Zack ended up turning back on the 21st lap.\nI’m a bit bummed I didn’t get much of a chance to chat with Zack and Lindsay afterward, but I’m sure I will next year. If you’re reading this, you both get a hug and a Christmas Tree Cake next year."

    "text": "Ways to deal with ankle pain, like crying and yelling “fuck” during descents\nOn that 21st lap, around mile 85, my foot slipped off of a slick root, and I rolled my ankle. I walked the last mile of that lap and came in hurting. I switched shoes to an older pair that I knew had a little more ankle support because they were worn to fit my foot shape. I saw in my food cooler the sign Christian had made for me during my Skyline run. “No matter how dark it get, it always gets light again.”\nZack was gone, and David and I went out together. For the first time in a few laps, we were running together, but we didn’t really say much. David had been hurting for a while. I can tell he’s a tough MF. I tried to put that 1-2 min gap on him, like I’d been doing, but for the first time it didn’t stick. I started hobbling the downhills, even walking some of them due to the ankle pain, and he passed me. He asked what was going on, and I told him. I think he said something really nice as he put his gap on me. I don’t really remember, I was working to hold back tears at that point, both from the pain and worrying that such a good day (I still felt really strong) would be shut down by something as silly as a wet root.\nThis lap had some of the most excruciating physical pain I’ve ever been in. During the back half of the lap (“the bad woods”), I was saying (yelling) a lot of expletives on anything downhill and had tears rolling down my face. I couldn’t really stop to massage it and address issues because I had to keep the pace up to finish the lap on time. This is when the mantras came in helpful. I tried not to fight the pain; I needed to embrace it and let it wash over me, and eventually things would change. Either I wouldn’t finish a lap on time, or it would get better, but I had to keep doing my job. I took a lot of inspiration from having seen friends, including Zack, David, Lindsay, and Christian, put themselves through these dark places recently.\nI put on the most aggressive playlist I have and hunkered down in the cave deeper than I’ve ever been before. This lap also corresponded with my double-dose of caffeine, so I was able to use caffeine to numb myself a bit. I finished that lap with ~3 min to spare, my slowest lap du jour by over 3 min."

If 2 participants quit/time out on the same lap, the faster runner on the previous lap wins. During my quick refuel between laps, I got a tylenol from Josh, who reminded me to be smart and that he believed in me. I don’t remember that very clearly, but it was along those lines.\nI lined up with David for lap 22 and jokingly teased him by saying, “You know you don’t really have to do this, right?” and I think there was a fist bump in there too. He knew I was hurting. Looking back, though, I wish I hadn’t said that. At the time, I perceived him as stronger than me. He had gapped me on the last lap, I wasn’t sure I was going to make it back from this lap on time, but I knew I would try.\nTechnically, he was supposed to wear the chong, since he beat me back, and I pointed that out about a quarter mile into our 22nd lap. He said, “you can have it,” but I told him I’d make him wear it on the next lap.\nThat next lap never happened. I realized my ankle was no longer agonizing on the descents. Don’t get me wrong, it was still bad, but better as the tylenol and caffeine kicked in, and as I learned how to run on it. I thought about Josh’s comment to “be smart” and realized that last lap might have been David’s push for a win because there wasn’t too much left.\nLots of love to David, but I actually got a bit angry about that. I remember thinking, “This is my race, damn it. I’m in charge. He doesn’t get to make moves like that, and I decide when we finish.” I decided I was going to do to him what he just did to me, which was the first time in quite a while that I felt that competitiveness kick in like that, so thanks to David for unlocking something in me I hadn’t seen in a long time.\nOn the first longer climb of that lap (the ankle was better on the climbs), I decided he wasn’t going to see me again, and I put in the work for a gap. The gap opened up much quicker than normal, but I didn’t think it was in the bag yet. At one point ~30 min into each lap, you can see lights from people up to 9 min behind you, and I couldn’t see his. At that point, I realized that the previous lap had definitely been a hail Mary. I tried not to get my expectations too high, but I realized he was &gt;9 min behind my pace for a 53-minute lap. I wanted to win, but honestly I was starting to feel better again and didn’t want to win yet: I wanted David to keep going."

I also knew that there was a horde of other people (including other racers) who believed in me, and that was a really nice feeling. My body certainly doesn’t feel ready to attempt a beer mile PR, but it’s also not destroyed. Just 30 hours after finishing, I walked over a mile (uphill and in the snow, like my dad’s walk to school) with a 40 lb pack back home from the bus stop without any issues."

I’m co-advised by Cathy Lozupone and Chris Lowry.\nI’m interested in microbial community ecology, host-microbiome interactions, and drivers of resilience (both in microbial communities and in humans).\nMy research focuses on gut microbiome multi-omics integration, particularly host-microbiome dual transcriptomics data, with applications for studying the role of Helicobacter species as pathobionts influencing the development of colitis following psychosocial stress. I’m very interested in causal inference in high-dimensional datasets, compositional data analysis, biologically-informed statistical modeling, and sometimes machine learning if it’s the appropriate tool for the job."

    "text": "Background\nI grew up in rural Northwest Tennessee, the land of corn and soy. I recieved my BS in Nutrition at East Tennessee State University, despite nearly majoring in music. At ETSU, I worked in Dr. Andy Clark’s Nutritional Biochemistry Lab, which was my introduction to microbiome research.\nIn 2020, I moved west toward Boulder, Colorado, to join Chris Lowry’s Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Lab at CU Boulder. Initially motivated by the Lowry Lab’s work on whole body hyperthermia as an alternative treatment for major depressive disorder, I was very excited to study the impacts systemic physiology on behavior. Here, I found a passion for bioinformatics, microbial ecology, and studying the effects of microbial exposure on mood and stress-related disorders.\nIn 2021, I joined the Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology (IQ Bio) program via the BioFrontiers Institute. I was fortunate enough to spend the ’21-’22 academic year rotating with Cathy Lozupone, Noah Fierer, and Nichole Reisdorph, where I worked on projects regarding microbiome co-occurrence networks, identifying metabolic pathways in metagenomic datasets, and integrating metabolomics and microbiome data. This year was fundamental to my computer science education and development as an interdisciplinary scientist, so I’m very grateful for everything that Kristin Powell and the IQ Bio team have done for me.\nI also completed a team rotation project co-advised by Luke Evans and Maggie Stanislawski, where we constructed multi-omic risk scores to predict inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis with a transparent and interpretable framework using data from the Human Microbiome Project 2."
