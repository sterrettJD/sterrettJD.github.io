    "text": "About Me\nI’m currently a PhD student (co-advised by Cathy Lozupone and Chris Lowry) in the Integrative Physiology and Interdisciplinary Quantitative (IQ) Biology programs at the University of Colorado Boulder.\nI’m interested in microbial community ecology, host-microbiome interactions, and drivers of resilience (both in microbial communities and in humans).\nMy research focuses on gut microbiome multi-omics integration, particularly host-microbiome dual transcriptomics data, with applications for studying the role of Helicobacter species as pathobionts influencing the development of colitis following psychosocial stress.\nIn the IQ Biology program, I was fortunate enough to spend the ’21-’22 academic year rotating with Cathy Lozupone, Noah Fierer, and Nichole Reisdorph, where I worked on projects regarding microbiome networks, identifying metabolic pathways in metagenomic datasets, and integrating metabolomics and microbiome data.\nI also completed a team rotation project co-advised by Luke Evans, Maggie Stanislawski, and Chris Gignoux, where we constructed poly-omic risk scores to predict inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis with a transparent and interpretable framework using data from the Human Microbiome Project 2.\nPrior to starting my PhD, I was a MS student in Chris Lowry’s Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Lab at CU Boulder. In the Lowry Lab, I studied the impacts of microbial exposure on mood affective and stress-related disorders. Specifically, I’m interested in the effects of diet and the built environment on host microbiomes, and I’m interested in developing multi-omics approaches to characterizing changes to microbial communities and the immune system in response to psychosocial stress.\nBefore moving to Boulder in 2020, I completed my BS in Nutrition at East Tennessee State University, so I like to think about these questions in the context of diet and lifestyle interventions.\nOutside of the lab, I pursue ultra-distance running and cycling. Because of my combined interests in nutrition, endurance exercise, and stress physiology, I enjoy talking about training/coaching philosophy and am open to future research on these topics!\n\n\nRecent projects\n\nPoly-omic risk scores predict inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis (IQ Bio team rotation with Luke Evans, Maggie Stanislawski, and Chris Gignoux; other students include Chris Arehart, Ruth Quispe-Pilco, and Rosie Garris)\nSCNIC: Sparse Correlation Network Analysis for Compositional Data (IQ Bio rotation with Cathy Lozupone)\nA Metagenomic Investigation of Spatial and Temporal Changes in Sewage Microbiomes across a University Campus\nThe Influence of the Microbiota on Brain Structure and Function: Implications for Stress-Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders - A review chapter in Evolution, Biodiversity and a Reassessment of the Hygiene Hypothesis\nModulation of green tea compound absorption and neurotransmitter concentrations by the gut microbiome (IQ Bio rotation with Nichole Reisdorph)\nInteractive Microbial Ecology Exploration: Jupyter Book for a Python tutorial on investigating microbial communities\nNicotine metabolism genes in the oral metagenomes of nicotine users vs non-users (IQ Bio rotation with Noah Fierer)\nCharacterization of gut microbiome and metabolome in Helicobacter pylori patients in an underprivileged community in the United States"
