    "text": "Professional activities\nI’m a PhD candidate in the Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology program at the University of Colorado Boulder, housed by the Department of Integrative Physiology. I’m co-advised by Cathy Lozupone and Chris Lowry.\nI’m interested in microbial community ecology, host-microbiome interactions, and drivers of resilience (both in microbial communities and in humans).\nMy research focuses on gut microbiome multi-omics integration, particularly host-microbiome dual transcriptomics data, with applications for studying the role of Helicobacter species as pathobionts influencing the development of colitis following psychosocial stress. I’m very interested in causal inference in high-dimensional datasets, compositional data analysis, biologically-informed statistical modeling, and sometimes machine learning if it’s the appropriate tool for the job."

    "text": "Background\nI grew up in rural Northwest Tennessee, the land of corn and soy. I recieved my BS in Nutrition at East Tennessee State University, despite nearly majoring in music. At ETSU, I worked in Dr. Andy Clark’s Nutritional Biochemistry Lab, which was my introduction to microbiome research.\nIn 2020, I moved west toward Boulder, Colorado, to join Chris Lowry’s Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Lab at CU Boulder. Initially motivated by the Lowry Lab’s work on whole body hyperthermia as an alternative treatment for major depressive disorder, I was very excited to study the impacts systemic physiology on behavior. Here, I found a passion for bioinformatics, microbial ecology, and studying the effects of microbial exposure on mood and stress-related disorders.\nIn 2021, I joined the Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology (IQ Bio) program via the BioFrontiers Institute. I was fortunate enough to spend the ’21-’22 academic year rotating with Cathy Lozupone, Noah Fierer, and Nichole Reisdorph, where I worked on projects regarding microbiome co-occurrence networks, identifying metabolic pathways in metagenomic datasets, and integrating metabolomics and microbiome data. This year was fundamental to my computer science education and development as an interdisciplinary scientist, so I’m very grateful for everything that Kristin Powell and the IQ Bio team have done for me.\nI also completed a team rotation project co-advised by Luke Evans and Maggie Stanislawski, where we constructed multi-omic risk scores to predict inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis with a transparent and interpretable framework using data from the Human Microbiome Project 2."
