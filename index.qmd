## Who is John?
**I'm a community-oriented, interdisciplinary scientist with a passion for studying and building resilient systems.**


**Questions that interest me:**

- How do biological systems respond to stress?
- How do we infer causality in high-dimensional and compositional biological datasets (-omics data)?
- How should we collect and efficiently process terabytes of relevant genetic sequencing data on a regular basis?

**Fields/tools I like:**

- statistical ecology and genetics
- causal inference
- stress physiology
- ontologies and knowledge graphs
- machine learning


**What I do:** 

I build software for **efficient bioinformatic processing** and **biologically-inspired statistical modeling** of high-dimensional and compositional "-omics" data (e.g., metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics). 

This currently supports making custom **gene/protein engineering** and custom **synthetic biology product QC** at Integrated DNA Technologies. 

During my PhD, I focused on **ecology of the gut microbiome**, **host-microbe interactions** and the **gut-brain axis**. I utilize **causal inference** techniques and **machine learning**.

I gravitate toward **collaborative projects** (where I can help someone else develop the best tools to answer their biological questions) and **mentoring/teaching**, as I see these as two of the most direct ways I can do good.



**In other contexts:**

From a non-professional perspective, I like to explore the areas around me, particularly via ultra-distance trail running, cycling, and climbing. Music is a large part of my life, as I have played a variety of instruments for many years, with a focus on Appalachian folk on the banjo and jazz trombone. I'm passionate about building community and support networks for myself and those around me, which I often find myself doing through cooking, music, and sport.
