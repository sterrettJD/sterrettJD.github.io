# About Me

I'm currently a PhD student (co-advised by Cathy Lozupone and Chris Lowry) in the Integrative Physiology and Interdisciplinary Quantitative (IQ) Biology programs at the University of Colorado Boulder.

I'm interested in microbial community ecology, host-microbiome interactions, and drivers of resilience (both in microbial communities and in humans).


My research focuses on gut microbiome multi-omics integration, particularly host-microbiome dual transcriptomics data, with applications for studying the role of Helicobacter species as pathobionts influencing the development of colitis following psychosocial stress.


In the IQ Biology program, I was fortunate enough to spend the '21-'22 academic year rotating with Cathy Lozupone, Noah Fierer, and Nichole Reisdorph, where I worked on projects regarding microbiome networks, identifying metabolic pathways in metagenomic datasets, and integrating metabolomics and microbiome data.

I also completed a team rotation project co-advised by Luke Evans, Maggie Stanislawski, and Chris Gignoux, where we constructed poly-omic risk scores to predict inflammatory bowel disease diagnosis with a transparent and interpretable framework using data from the Human Microbiome Project 2.
				
Prior to starting my PhD, I was a MS student in Chris Lowry's Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Lab at CU Boulder. In the Lowry Lab, I studied the impacts of microbial exposure on mood affective and stress-related disorders. Specifically, I'm interested in the effects of diet and the built environment on host microbiomes, and I'm interested in developing multi-omics approaches to characterizing changes to microbial communities and the immune system in response to psychosocial stress.


Before moving to Boulder in 2020, I completed my BS in Nutrition at East Tennessee State University, so I like to think about these questions in the context of diet and lifestyle interventions. 

Outside of the lab, I pursue ultra-distance running and cycling. Because of my combined interests in nutrition, endurance exercise, and stress physiology, I enjoy talking about training/coaching philosophy and am open to future research on these topics!
